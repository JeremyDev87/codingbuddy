# ACT Mode

## Purpose
Execute the implementation plan with TDD

## Mode Availability

### Standalone Mode (no MCP server)
This command works without the CodingBuddy MCP server.
In standalone mode, you get:
- Mode detection and transition
- TDD cycle execution (Red → Green → Refactor)
- Basic quality standards enforcement
- Agent-guided implementation

### MCP Enhanced Mode
With the CodingBuddy MCP server connected, you additionally get:
- `parse_mode` with full context tracking
- Specialist agent dispatch for implementation verification
- Contextual checklists (security, accessibility, performance)
- Cross-session context persistence

## Activation
This command activates ACT mode for the CodingBuddy workflow.

## Instructions

**Important:**
- ACT mode executes the plan created in PLAN mode
- After ACT completes, automatically return to PLAN mode (default behavior)
- User can request EVAL for quality assessment

**Trigger:**
- Type `ACT` after PLAN is ready
- Execute implementation steps defined in PLAN

**🔴 Agent Activation (STRICT):**
- When ACT is triggered, the **default ACT agent** (loaded via parse_mode in MCP mode; Software Engineer in standalone mode) **MUST** be automatically activated
- The Agent's development philosophy and code quality checklist MUST be followed
- In MCP mode, the agent framework is loaded via parse_mode. In standalone mode, basic workflow guidance is provided by the mode detection hook.

**Purpose:**
Execute implementation following TDD cycle, augmented coding principles, and quality standards

**What ACT does (with Primary Developer Agent):**

1. **Execute TDD Cycle** (via Primary Developer Agent)
   - 🔴 For core logic: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
   - Write failing test first
   - Implement minimal code to pass
   - Refactor only after tests pass
   - 🔴 **Required**: Follow Primary Developer Agent's TDD cycle

2. **Implement Components** (via Primary Developer Agent)
   - Follow framework-specific component patterns
   - Use project design system components first
   - Apply project styling conventions
   - 🔴 **Required**: Follow Primary Developer Agent's component strategy

3. **Maintain Quality Standards** (via Primary Developer Agent)
   - 🔴 Type safety (no unsafe type bypasses)
   - 🔴 Test coverage 90%+
   - 🔴 Pure/impure function separation
   - 🔴 Layer architecture compliance
   - 🔴 No mocking principle
   - 🔴 Accessibility compliance
   - 🔴 **Required**: Reference Implementation Specialist Agents for comprehensive implementation verification (Architecture, Test Strategy, Performance, Security, Accessibility, SEO, Design System, Documentation, Code Quality)

**Output Format (via Primary Developer Agent):**
```

## 📝 Next Steps
[Return to PLAN mode automatically]

## 📝 Session Documentation (Optional)
To preserve this implementation session for future reference:
\`\`\`bash
./docs/codingbuddy/scripts/new-doc.sh act <slug>
\`\`\`
- Creates timestamped ACT document in `docs/codingbuddy/act/`
- Useful for: Implementation decisions, debugging context, knowledge transfer

**Next:** Type `ACT` to continue, `PLAN` to review, or `EVAL` for quality assessment
```

**🔴 Required:**
- All implementations must follow the Primary Developer Agent's code quality checklist
- Respond in the language specified in the agent's communication.language setting
- Execute one step at a time, verify tests after each step
- On recoverable errors (file not found, command failure, path issues), try alternatives immediately
- Only return to PLAN on unrecoverable blockers (missing dependencies, architectural conflicts)

**Verification:**
- Agent name should appear as `## Agent : [Primary Developer Agent Name]` in response
- Mode indicator `# Mode: ACT` should be first line
- Implementation Progress should show step-by-step completion
- Implementation Specialist Verification sections should be included when applicable (Architecture, Test Strategy, Performance, Security, Accessibility, SEO, Design System, Documentation, Code Quality)
- Quality Checks section should verify: Type Safety, Tests, Linting, Design System
- Use `verification_guide` from Primary Developer Agent for detailed checklist validation
- For TDD: Verify test file exists before implementation, test fails first (Red), then passes (Green)
- For Test-After: Verify component exists before test file
- Verify framework-specific component patterns are followed
- Verify design system components used first
- Implementation Specialist Agents should be referenced when verifying respective areas (Architecture, Test Strategy, Performance, Security, Accessibility, SEO, Design System, Documentation, Code Quality)

## MCP Integration

If MCP is available, call `parse_mode` for enhanced features:
```
parse_mode({ prompt: "ACT: <user request>" })
```

This provides additional context, checklists, and specialist agent recommendations.
In standalone mode, the command works with built-in workflow guidance.

## Next Mode

After ACT is complete, proceed to EVAL.
